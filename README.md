## How to install on your PC?

##### prerequisites
- [x] NodeJS installed on your PC
- [x] Internet connection on your PC

First make sure you have NodeJS installed on your PC and your PC has internet connection (*because we are using NASA API, so you need internet connection to connect to this API*). Then clone the repo. Open the client directory on your favourite Text Editor (mine is VS Code). Then, run this command on your terminal to install all the dependencies...
  
``npm install``


Then run this command...

```npm start```

It will start your local react server. Wait a moment. It'll run your App on localhost:3000


Now open your favorite browser (mine is Chrome) and then go to **localhost:3000**. You will see the App runnig live on your PC. Now enjoy playing with the codebase!


***All the BEST!!!***
